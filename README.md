# Python-backend-React.js-frontend-experiment

experimental test to take the knolwedge from my previous course mainly using python, and combine it with the knowledge from the most recent course I have completed in full stack web development. The goal of this project is to create a full stack application while increasing my stack with a python back end.

## intended technoligies 
- Python
- Django
- Djangorestframework
- Django-cors-headers
- Pip
- Pipevn

- Java Script
- React
- React-redux
- React-router-dom
- Node

- HTML
- CSS

## Steps to follow

- [x] Research python packet managers and how to use them
- [x] Research Django and how to intergrate it into my current stack
- [x] Draft up concept for test web app
- [ ] Create basic js frontend
- [ ] Create basic python backend
- [ ] implement frontend test suite
- [ ] research python test suite
- [ ] enhance basic concept
- [ ] refeactor to more enhanced concept 
- [ ] document learnings from experimental project

## project concept

create a fruit bowl with conditional rendering that allows you to toggal fruit images buy adding/removing fruit from the fruit bowl. Fruit that can be used and image url etc. will come from db and the current state of the fruit bowl will be saveable.
